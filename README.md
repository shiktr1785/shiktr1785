## 🚀 About Me

I work primarily in digital design and verification, with a design-oriented mindset that helps me understand failure modes and corner cases early.  
My background includes exposure to analog fundamentals and backend concepts, which helps me reason about timing, constraints, and implementation trade-offs.

I am currently strengthening my skills in **SystemVerilog and UVM-based verification**, along with Linux and TCL-based automation, through hands-on coursework and projects at C-DAC.
